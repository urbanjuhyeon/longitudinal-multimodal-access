    "text": "2.1.1 What is GTFS?\nThe General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a standardized data format for public transportation schedules and geographic information. Originally developed by Google in 2005 for trip planning applications, GTFS has become the de facto international standard for representing transit systems.\nA GTFS dataset is a collection of text files (packaged as a .zip archive) containing:\n\nRoutes: Bus, metro, and train lines\nStops: Station and stop locations with coordinates\nTrips: Specific vehicle journeys along routes\nStop times: When each trip arrives/departs each stop\nCalendar: Service availability by date and day of week\nShapes (optional): Geographic paths that routes follow\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Why GTFS matters for accessibility\nGTFS enables realistic transit routing because it captures temporal complexity:\n\nSchedule accuracy: Actual departure/arrival times, not assumed frequencies\nService variation: Different schedules for weekday/weekend, peak/off-peak\nTemporal validity: Calendar defines when schedules apply\nMultimodal integration: Includes walk transfers between stops/lines\n\nThis temporal dimension is critical for longitudinal analysis. Transit service changes—new routes, frequency adjustments, coverage expansion—are reflected in updated GTFS feeds, making it possible to track how public transport accessibility evolves.\n\n\n2.1.3 Where to obtain GTFS\nGTFS availability has grown dramatically:\nGlobal repositories\n\nMobility Database: 2,000+ feeds worldwide\nTransitFeeds: Historical and current feeds\nTransit agency websites: Many agencies publish GTFS directly\n\nSouth Korea\n\nKTDB (Korea Transport Database): National GTFS feeds\nCovers intercity, metropolitan, and local transit systems\nAvailable for download with registration\n\nTemporal coverage\nFor longitudinal analysis, you need GTFS snapshots from multiple time points. Some agencies maintain archives; others require manual collection over time. The Mobility Database and TransitFeeds preserve historical versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteData acquisition in this book\n\n\n\nDetailed GTFS download and preprocessing workflows for South Korea are covered in:\n\nSection 3.2: Pilot data preparation (Paldal-gu)\nSection 4.2: National data preparation\n\nHere we focus on conceptual understanding rather than step-by-step data acquisition.",

    "text": "2.2 OpenStreetMap: Collaborative street networks\n\n2.2.1 What is OpenStreetMap?\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project creating a free, editable map of the world. Think of it as “Wikipedia for maps”—volunteers contribute geographic data including:\n\nRoad networks: Streets, highways, pedestrian paths, cycle lanes\nRoad attributes: Speed limits, surface types, lane counts\nPoints of interest: Buildings, amenities, landmarks\nAdministrative boundaries: City, district, neighborhood borders\n\nFor accessibility analysis, we primarily use OSM’s street network data.\n\n\n2.2.2 Why OSM for accessibility?\nOSM offers unique advantages over proprietary map data:\nOpen and free\n\nNo licensing costs or usage restrictions\nEnables reproducible research\n\nGlobal coverage\n\nEspecially strong in areas without commercial mapping\nCommunity maintains and updates continuously\n\nRich attributes\n\nTags describe road types (motorway, residential, footway)\nAttributes enable mode-specific routing (car vs walk vs bike)\n\nProgrammable access\n\nAPIs and tools for bulk download\nStandard formats (.pbf, .osm) work with routing engines\n\n\n\n2.2.3 OSM data structure\nOSM represents geography through three primitives:\n\nNodes: Points with latitude/longitude\nWays: Ordered lists of nodes forming lines or polygons\nRelations: Logical groupings of nodes/ways (e.g., bus routes)\n\nFor routing, we need ways representing streets, tagged with attributes like:\n\nhighway=motorway, highway=residential, highway=footway\nmaxspeed=50\nlanes=2\nsurface=asphalt\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Obtaining OSM data\nGlobal extracts\n\nGeofabrik: Daily-updated country/region extracts\nBBBike: Custom area extracts\n\nOSM APIs\n\nOverpass API: Custom queries for specific features\nosmnx (Python), osmdata (R): Programmatic access\n\nSouth Korea\nGeofabrik provides South Korea extracts updated daily in .pbf (Protocolbuffer Binary Format), the compact format used by routing engines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantTemporal consistency\n\n\n\nFor longitudinal analysis, OSM presents a challenge: the database continuously updates. To ensure temporal validity:\n\nDownload OSM extracts from dates matching your GTFS feeds\nUse services archiving historical OSM data (e.g., Geofabrik’s historical extracts)\nIn practice, road network changes are slower than transit schedule changes, making minor temporal mismatches acceptable for most analyses",

    "text": "8.2 Research Context\n\n8.2.1 The Problem: Accelerating Branch Closures\nKorean bank branches declined 24% over a decade (7,673 in 2012 → 5,800 in 2022), driven by digital banking adoption and cost pressures12. Meanwhile, internet banking surged from 53% to 78% of transactions, while in-person services dropped from 9% to 6%.\n\n\n8.2.2 Why This Matters: Spatial and Social Inequity\nThree critical concerns emerge3:\n\nAge disparity: Elderly (70+) use bank branches 2× more than average (54% vs 25%)4\nGeographic inequality: Longest travel distances (&gt;20km) concentrated in aged rural areas (26 of top 30 regions are super-aged)5\nService gaps: Non-bank institutions (savings banks, cooperatives) show similar spatial bias—closures cannot be compensated6\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Research Questions\nGiven this context, we ask:\n\nWhere have accessibility declines been most severe?\nWho is most affected (elderly, rural, transit-dependent populations)?\nHow much has multimodal accessibility changed over time?\nWhat spatial patterns distinguish banking deserts from well-served areas?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote📚 Detailed Policy Background (Click to Expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.4 Regulatory Responses\n2023 Bank Branch Closure Enhancement Plan7:\n\nStrengthened pre-closure impact assessments with external experts\nMandatory consultation with local communities before closure\nRequired alternative arrangements (partner branches, ATMs, mobile banking education)\nPost-closure follow-up evaluation\n\n2025 Banking Agency System8:\n\nAllows non-bank entities (post offices, mutual cooperatives) to provide bank services\nAims to expand face-to-face service channels\nLimitations: Cannot fully replicate branch service quality and range\n\n\n\n8.2.5 Academic Evidence\nLee (2025) provides the first systematic spatial analysis of Korean bank branch distribution9:\n\nMethodology: Analyzed travel distances to nearest bank using Voronoi tessellation\nKey finding: Super-aged regions (65+ &gt;20%) systematically have longer access distances\nInsight: Non-bank financial institutions exhibit similar spatial inequalities\nPolicy implication: Holistic evaluation needed—delegated services alone insufficient\n\n\n\n8.2.6 International Context\nBank branch closures are a global phenomenon affecting developed economies:\n\nUnited States: “Banking deserts” identified in rural and low-income urban areas\nCanada: Distance-based closure regulations (10km threshold for rural areas)\nAustralia: Tiered notification requirements (12 weeks for &gt;20km access)\nUnited Kingdom: Banking hubs and post office partnerships to maintain access\n\nKorea’s challenge is compounded by rapid aging (super-aged society by 2025) and extreme geographic concentration (50% of population in Seoul Capital Area).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip💡 Why This Analysis Uses R5R\n\n\n\nTraditional GIS-based accessibility studies face limitations:\n\nStatic networks: Cannot model time-varying transit schedules\nMode siloes: Car and transit analyzed separately\nComputational cost: National-scale many-to-many routing infeasible\n\nR5R solves these:\n\n✓ Multimodal routing with realistic transit schedules (GTFS)\n✓ Raptor algorithm enables massive-scale many-to-many OD matrices\n✓ Parallel processing via spatial partitioning (province-level chunks)\n\nSee Chapters 3-6 for workflow validation.",
