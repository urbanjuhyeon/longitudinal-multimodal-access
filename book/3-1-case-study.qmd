# Case Study: Bank Accessibility Analysis {#sec-case-study}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Part III: Application

The next four chapters apply the R5R workflow to a more complex case: **banking accessibility across South Korea over multiple time periods**. This introduces challenges in data integration (multiple heterogeneous datasets), computational efficiency (250M OD pairs), and policy-relevant analysis.
:::

## Introduction

This chapter presents the research context and study design for analyzing **how bank accessibility has changed across South Korea due to branch closures**.

We examine **national-scale accessibility changes from 2021-2023**, focusing on:

-   Spatial inequality in banking access across 50,000+ census districts
-   Differences between car and transit accessibility
-   Differential impacts on elderly vs. general populations
-   Geographic patterns of financial service deserts

This demonstrates **scaling the R5R workflow from a single city (Part II) to nationwide analysis** while maintaining computational feasibility and methodological rigor.

## Research Context

### The Problem: Accelerating Branch Closures

Korean bank branches declined **24% over a decade** (7,673 in 2012 → 5,800 in 2022), driven by digital banking adoption and cost pressures[^fsc2023][^fsc2025]. Meanwhile, internet banking surged from 53% to 78% of transactions, while in-person services dropped from 9% to 6%.

### Why This Matters: Spatial and Social Inequity

Three critical concerns emerge[^lee2025]:

1.  **Age disparity**: Elderly (70+) use bank branches 2× more than average (54% vs 25%)[^fsc2023]
2.  **Geographic inequality**: Longest travel distances (>20km) concentrated in aged rural areas (26 of top 30 regions are super-aged)[^lee2025]
3.  **Service gaps**: Non-bank institutions (savings banks, cooperatives) show similar spatial bias—closures cannot be compensated[^lee2025]

### Research Questions

Given this context, we ask:

-   **Where** have accessibility declines been most severe?
-   **Who** is most affected (elderly, rural, transit-dependent populations)?
-   **How much** has multimodal accessibility changed over time?
-   **What** spatial patterns distinguish banking deserts from well-served areas?

## 📚 Detailed Policy Background (Click to Expand)

### Regulatory Responses

**2023 Bank Branch Closure Enhancement Plan**[^fsc2023]:

-   Strengthened pre-closure impact assessments with external experts
-   Mandatory consultation with local communities before closure
-   Required alternative arrangements (partner branches, ATMs, mobile banking education)
-   Post-closure follow-up evaluation

**2025 Banking Agency System**[^fsc2025]:

-   Allows non-bank entities (post offices, mutual cooperatives) to provide bank services
-   Aims to expand face-to-face service channels
-   Limitations: Cannot fully replicate branch service quality and range

### Academic Evidence

Lee (2025) provides the first systematic spatial analysis of Korean bank branch distribution[^lee2025]:

-   **Methodology**: Analyzed travel distances to nearest bank using Voronoi tessellation
-   **Key finding**: Super-aged regions (65+ >20%) systematically have longer access distances
-   **Insight**: Non-bank financial institutions exhibit similar spatial inequalities
-   **Policy implication**: Holistic evaluation needed—delegated services alone insufficient

### International Context

Bank branch closures are a global phenomenon affecting developed economies:

-   **United States**: "Banking deserts" identified in rural and low-income urban areas
-   **Canada**: Distance-based closure regulations (10km threshold for rural areas)
-   **Australia**: Tiered notification requirements (12 weeks for \>20km access)
-   **United Kingdom**: Banking hubs and post office partnerships to maintain access

Korea's challenge is compounded by **rapid aging** (super-aged society by 2025) and **extreme geographic concentration** (50% of population in Seoul Capital Area).

## 💡 Why This Analysis Uses R5R

Traditional GIS-based accessibility studies face limitations:

- **Static networks**: Cannot model time-varying transit schedules
- **Mode siloes**: Car and transit analyzed separately
- **Computational cost**: National-scale many-to-many routing infeasible

**R5R solves these**:

- ✓ **Multimodal routing** with realistic transit schedules (GTFS)
- ✓ **Raptor algorithm** enables massive-scale many-to-many OD matrices
- ✓ **Parallel processing** via spatial partitioning (province-level chunks)

See Chapters 3-6 for workflow validation.

## Study Design Overview

### Geographic Scope

**Coverage**: All of South Korea (nationwide analysis)

**Why national scale?**

- Banking regulations are uniform across regions
- Branch closures follow nationwide strategic decisions
- Urban-rural disparities require comprehensive coverage

**Spatial resolution**:

- **Origins**: ~50,000 census enumeration districts (집계구)
- **Analysis levels**: District → Eup/Myeon/Dong → Si/Gun/Gu → Province
- **Coverage**: 17 provinces/metropolitan cities, ~250 Si/Gun/Gu

### Temporal Scope

- **Period**: 2021-2023 (6 semi-annual snapshots)
- **Frequency**: June and December of each year
- **Alignment**: Matches GTFS transit data releases

### Comparison with Pilot Study

| Aspect | Pilot (Part II) | Application (Part III) |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Geography** | Paldal-gu (1 district) | All of South Korea |
| **Origins** | ~80 census tracts | ~50,000 enum. districts |
| **Destinations** | ~20 bank branches | ~5,000 branches |
| **Time periods** | 1 snapshot | 6 snapshots (2021-2023) |
| **OD pairs** | ~1,600 | ~250 million |
| **Processing** | Minutes | Hours/Days |

## Data Sources Overview

This analysis integrates four primary datasets:

| Dataset | Source | Temporal Coverage | Use in Analysis |
|---------|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Bank branches** | Korea Federation of Banks | 2021-2023 (semi-annual) | Destinations for accessibility |
| **Transit networks** | KTDB GTFS | 2022-2023 (annual) | Transit routing via R5R |
| **Road networks** | OpenStreetMap | 2021-2023 (annual) | Car routing via R5R |
| **Census data** | SGIS | 2021-2023 (annual) | Origin points + demographics |

### Key Data Challenges

**1. Geocoding**
- Bank addresses reported in varying formats across time
- Requires standardization and quality control

**2. Temporal Alignment**
- Bank data: semi-annual (June/Dec)
- Transit GTFS: annual (March)
- OSM road networks: annual snapshots
- Solution: Match to nearest available dates

**3. Spatial Coverage**
- Ensure all origins/destinations fall within network bounds
- Handle islands and remote areas with limited transit

**4. Data Volume**
- 5,000+ bank branches × 13 time periods = 65,000 records
- 50,000+ enumeration districts
- Multiple GTFS feeds spanning all provinces

## Analytical Framework

### Core Metrics

We calculate **travel time from each enumeration district to the nearest bank branch** using multimodal routing:

**Transport modes analyzed**:

- **Public transit + walking**: Realistic accessibility for transit-dependent populations
- **Private car**: Benchmark for car-owning households

**Key indicators**:

1. **Minimum travel time**: Time to nearest bank branch
2. **Number of banks within X minutes**: Service redundancy measure
3. **Temporal change**: Δ accessibility from 2021 to 2023

### Methodological Approach

The validated R5R workflow from Part II is adapted for national scale with three key strategies:

**1. Spatial Partitioning** (Chapter 9)

- Divide national analysis into province-level chunks
- Process each province independently to manage memory
- Combine results after completion

**2. Parallel Processing** (Chapter 9)

- Use `{future}` and `{furrr}` for multi-core execution
- Configure workers based on available computational resources
- Monitor progress and handle errors gracefully

**3. Hierarchical Aggregation** (Chapter 10)

- Calculate district-level accessibility (finest resolution)
- Aggregate to Eup/Myeon/Dong using population weights
- Further aggregate to Si/Gun/Gu and Province levels
- Preserve both fine-grained detail and policy-relevant summaries

    F --> G[Maps & insights<br/>Chapter 10]
```

### Travel Time Thresholds

We define "accessible" based on realistic trip expectations:

- **Public transit + walking**: 30 minutes (urban standard)
- **Private car**: 15 minutes (comparable to transit in well-served areas)

Rationale: Bank visits are purposeful trips that justify longer travel times compared to daily services (groceries, schools).

## Preview of Results

Detailed results, visualizations, and policy implications are presented in **Chapter 10: Results and Visualization**.

Key analyses will include:

**Spatial patterns**:

- Which regions have highest/lowest banking accessibility?
- Identification of "banking deserts" (low accessibility zones)
- Urban-rural accessibility gaps

**Temporal changes**:

- How has accessibility changed from 2021 to 2023?
- Which areas experienced greatest declines?
- Were branch closures concentrated in specific regions?

**Demographic equity**:

- Accessibility for elderly populations vs general population
- Transit-dependent vs car-owning households
- Vulnerable populations affected by closures

**Policy relevance**:

- Evidence for branch closure approval processes
- Spatial targeting for alternative service provision
- Transit investment priorities
