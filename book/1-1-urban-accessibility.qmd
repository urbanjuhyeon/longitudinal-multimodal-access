# Urban accessibility over time {#sec-urban-accessibility}

## What is accessibility?

Urban accessibility refers to the ease with which people can reach essential services, opportunities, and activities using available transportation systems. Unlike simple distance-based proximity, accessibility accounts for the complex interplay between:

- **People**: Where individuals live and their mobility capabilities
- **Places**: The spatial distribution of destinations (jobs, healthcare, education, banks)
- **Transport**: The multimodal networks connecting origins to destinations

This concept is fundamental to understanding urban equity and quality of life. A neighborhood might be geographically close to essential services but poorly accessible if transportation connections are inadequate or inconvenient.

## The limitations of static accessibility

Most accessibility analyses treat cities as frozen snapshots, calculating access at a single point in time. This static view misses critical dynamics:

**Services relocate or close**

- Bank branch consolidation leaves neighborhoods underserved
- Healthcare facilities open in new locations
- Supermarkets close in low-income areas

**Transport networks evolve**

- New transit lines extend service coverage
- Route restructuring changes travel times
- Infrastructure improvements alter commute patterns

**Land use changes**

- Residential development shifts population centers
- Commercial zones emerge or decline
- Urban sprawl extends city boundaries

A single-year analysis cannot capture these transformations or their equity implications.

## Why track accessibility over time?

Longitudinal accessibility analysis reveals patterns invisible in cross-sectional studies:

**Detecting growing inequalities**

Service centralization often benefits well-connected urban cores while disadvantaging peripheral areas. Only temporal tracking shows whether gaps are widening or narrowing.

**Evaluating policy impacts**

Transport investments and service location policies play out over years. Longitudinal data connects interventions to outcomes, separating policy effects from background trends.

**Understanding cumulative disadvantage**

Communities experiencing persistent poor accessibility face compounding challenges in economic participation, health outcomes, and social mobility.

## The multimodal dimension

People reach destinations through different transportation modes with vastly different accessibility profiles:

**Private vehicles** offer flexibility and speed but require:
- Car ownership and maintenance costs
- Driving ability
- Parking availability
- Tolerance for congestion

**Public transit** provides affordable mobility but involves:
- Fixed routes and schedules
- Waiting and transfer times
- Limited service coverage
- Temporal availability (peak vs off-peak, weekday vs weekend)

**Walking and cycling** are sustainable options constrained by:
- Physical capability
- Distance tolerance
- Weather and topography
- Infrastructure quality

Analyzing only one mode obscures how accessibility is distributed across different population groups. A location might have excellent car accessibility but poor transit access—a pattern that systematically disadvantages lower-income, elderly, and disabled populations who disproportionately rely on public transport.

## Banking accessibility in South Korea: A case study

This book demonstrates longitudinal multimodal accessibility analysis through a concrete example: tracking access to banking services in South Korea from 2021 to 2023.

**Why banking services?**

Financial service access is essential for economic participation yet increasingly threatened by branch closures as banking digitalizes. Physical branches remain critical for:

- Older adults less comfortable with digital banking
- Complex transactions requiring in-person assistance
- Communities with limited digital infrastructure

**The South Korean context**

South Korea experienced significant bank branch consolidation in the early 2020s, creating natural variation in accessibility changes across time and space. The country also provides high-quality open data:

- GTFS transit schedules from KTDB (Korea Transport Database)
- Comprehensive street networks from OpenStreetMap
- Detailed census boundaries and population data

**Analytical scope**

We compare accessibility by private car versus public transit across approximately 50,000 enumeration districts, tracking how access changed over six time points (two per year, 2021-2023). This reveals:

- Which communities lost banking access
- Whether transit-dependent populations were disproportionately affected
- How accessibility gaps evolved over time

## Beyond this example

While our case study focuses on banking in South Korea, the methods generalize to:

- **Other service types**: Healthcare, education, retail, employment
- **Other geographic contexts**: Any region with GTFS and street network data
- **Other time periods**: Any span where comparable data exist

The workflow presented in this book provides infrastructure for reproducible longitudinal accessibility analysis applicable wherever standardized transport and service location data are available.

## Structure of this book

The remaining chapters build toward national-scale longitudinal accessibility analysis:

**SECTION 1: Introduction** (this section)

- Chapter 2 introduces GTFS and OpenStreetMap data
- Chapter 3 explains the r5r routing engine

**SECTION 2: Methodology Development**

- Network setup and parameters
- Three routing patterns: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many
- Building reusable code for longitudinal analysis

**SECTION 3: Pilot Application**

- Small-scale implementation in Paldal-gu, Suwon
- Method validation with manageable data
- Development of computational strategies

**SECTION 4: National-Scale Application**

- Scaling to 50,000+ origins and 6 time points
- Spatial partitioning and parallel processing
- Results visualization and interpretation

By the end, you will understand both the conceptual foundations and practical implementation of reproducible longitudinal multimodal accessibility research.
