## Introduction

This chapter reflects on the methods, tools, and approaches presented throughout the book. We will discuss the strengths and limitations of the open-source accessibility modeling framework, compare it to alternative approaches, and consider future directions for research and practice.

Key topics include the trade-offs between model complexity and usability, the role of open-source tools in democratizing accessibility analysis, and emerging trends in transportation modeling. We will also address common challenges practitioners face and offer guidance for overcoming them.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of the presented methods
- Compare open-source approaches to commercial or proprietary alternatives
- Identify areas for future methodological development
- Understand the broader context of accessibility modeling in planning practice
