## Part II: Methodology Development

The next four chapters demonstrate the complete R5R accessibility workflow using **banking accessibility in Suwon's Paldal-gu district** as a working example. This provides a manageable case (80 census tracts, ~20 bank branches) to learn R5R functions, verify outputs, and develop reusable code patterns.

## Introduction

Before conducting accessibility analysis, we must build a multimodal transportation network and configure routing parameters. This chapter demonstrates network setup using R5R, which combines OpenStreetMap road networks and GTFS transit data into a unified routing engine.

## Building the R5R Network

R5R constructs a multimodal network from the preprocessed data files we created in Chapter 2.

```{r}
#| label: setup-r5r
#| eval: false

library(r5r)

# Set paths
pilot_data_dir <- "outputs/pilot/data"

# Build network
r5r_core <- setup_r5(
  data_path = pilot_data_dir,
  verbose = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

The `setup_r5()` function:

- Loads OSM `.pbf` file for street network
- Loads GTFS `.zip` file for transit schedules
- Builds transfer connections between modes
- Creates a routable graph structure
- Saves `network.dat` file for reuse

## Build Time
Network building takes 1-5 minutes depending on data size. The `network.dat` file can be reused for subsequent analyses with the same data.
:::

## Parameter Configuration

Routing behavior is controlled by several key parameters that significantly affect results.

### Temporal Parameters

```{r}
#| label: temporal-params
#| eval: false

ANALYSIS_DATE <- "2021-06-15"
DEPARTURE_TIME <- "09:00:00"

DEPARTURE_TIME_obj <- as.POSIXct(
  paste(ANALYSIS_DATE, DEPARTURE_TIME)
)
```

**Considerations:**

- Date must fall within GTFS `calendar.txt` validity period
- Departure time affects transit availability (peak vs off-peak)
- Multiple time windows may be needed for robust analysis

### Routing Parameters

```{r}
#| label: routing-params
#| eval: false

MAX_WALK_TIME <- 30        # minutes
MAX_TRIP_DURATION <- 120   # minutes
```

**Parameter meanings:**

- `max_walk_time`: Maximum walking distance to/from transit or for entire walk-only trips
- `max_trip_duration`: Total journey time limit (all modes combined)

::: {.callout-warning}
## Walk-Only Mode Exception
For walk-only routing, use extended `max_walk_time` (e.g., 120 minutes) and set `shortest_path = FALSE` to avoid routing errors.
:::

### Mode-Specific Settings

```{r}
#| label: mode-config
#| eval: false

# Mode configurations
mode_config <- list(
  "PT" = c("WALK", "TRANSIT"),  # Public Transit
  "CAR" = c("CAR"),
  "WALK" = c("WALK")
)

# Shortest path settings
# CAR, PT: shortest_path = TRUE
# WALK: shortest_path = FALSE
```

The `shortest_path` parameter controls route optimization:

- `TRUE`: Minimize cumulative distance (may yield circuitous routes)
- `FALSE`: Consider multiple route alternatives

### Accessibility Thresholds

For many-to-many analyses, we define time thresholds to count accessible opportunities:

```{r}
#| label: thresholds
#| eval: false

TIME_THRESHOLD_CAR <- 10   # minutes
TIME_THRESHOLD_PT <- 20    # minutes
```

**Rationale:**

- Car: 10 minutes covers ~5-8 km in urban areas
- Public Transit: 20 minutes accounts for waiting and transfers
- Thresholds should match study area buffer and research questions

## Pilot Study Area

Our pilot test uses Paldal-gu (Suwon) with 1,500m buffer:

- **Study region:** Paldal-gu (수원시 팔달구)
- **Year:** 2021
- **Buffer:** 1,500 meters
- **Census tracts:** ~80 output areas

## Summary

This chapter established:

- ✓ R5R network building procedure
- ✓ Key parameter definitions and their impacts
- ✓ Pilot study area characteristics

With the network built and parameters configured, we proceed to test three Origin-Destination patterns in the following chapters.
