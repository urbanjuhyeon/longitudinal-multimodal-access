# Preparing Analysis Datasets {#sec-data-preparation}

## Introduction

With the research context established in Chapter 7, we now turn to **data preparation**—the unglamorous but critical foundation of large-scale accessibility analysis.

This chapter covers:

- **Bank location data**: Geocoding 5,000+ branches across 13 time periods
- **Transit networks**: Preparing national GTFS feeds for R5R
- **Census geographies**: Processing enumeration district boundaries and demographics
- **Data integration**: Creating analysis-ready origin-destination pairs

Unlike the pilot study (Chapter 2), where data came from a single source and time period, the national case study requires **harmonizing multiple heterogeneous datasets** with different formats, temporal coverage, and spatial precision.

## Why This Matters

Poor data preparation causes:

❌ **Geocoding errors** → Routes to wrong locations
❌ **Temporal mismatches** → Transit schedules don't match analysis dates
❌ **Boundary inconsistencies** → Origins/destinations outside network coverage
❌ **Missing values** → Incomplete accessibility estimates

Quality control at this stage prevents **garbage-in-garbage-out** problems downstream.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Process semi-annual bank branch reports into geocoded point data
- Validate and prepare national GTFS feeds for R5R
- Generate origin points from census boundaries
- Implement data quality checks and documentation
- Structure datasets for efficient large-scale routing
