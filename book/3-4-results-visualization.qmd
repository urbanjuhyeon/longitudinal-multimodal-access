# Results and Visualization {#sec-results-visualization}

## Introduction

With routing complete (Chapter 9), we now have **enumeration-district-level accessibility estimates** for 50,000+ locations across three time periods. The final step is transforming raw travel times into **policy-relevant insights**.

This chapter covers:

**1. Spatial Aggregation**
- Population-weighted aggregation to Eup/Myeon/Dong and Si/Gun/Gu
- Preserving demographic representativeness
- Handling boundary changes across time periods

**2. Temporal Change Detection**
- Calculating accessibility changes (2021 vs 2023)
- Identifying areas with largest declines
- Statistical significance testing

**3. Visualization Strategies**
- Choropleth maps of banking accessibility
- Temporal comparison (small multiples, difference maps)
- Demographic disparities (elderly vs general population)
- Interactive web maps for exploration

**4. Policy Interpretation**
- Identifying "banking deserts" (low accessibility zones)
- Quantifying vulnerable populations affected
- Connecting findings to policy context (Chapter 7)
- Limitations and caveats

## From Numbers to Narrative

Raw accessibility metrics are not self-explanatory. Effective communication requires:

✓ **Context**: How do current levels compare to past trends or other regions?
✓ **Equity lens**: Who is most affected by accessibility gaps?
✓ **Actionability**: What can policymakers do with this information?

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Aggregate enumeration district results to administrative units
- Calculate population-weighted accessibility indicators
- Detect temporal changes and spatial inequalities
- Create publication-quality maps and visualizations
- Interpret accessibility results for policy audiences
- Export results for further analysis or reporting
